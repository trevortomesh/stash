- **DeepStash** â€“ A sister project to Stash that provides advanced long-term archival and external drive backup for deeply cold files.

  ### ðŸ§Š Suggested Use:
  You can find and install DeepStash here: https://github.com/trevortomesh/deep-stash

  DeepStash is designed to work alongside Stash â€” but it also stands strong on its own. Use it to offload files and folders to a long-term archive (such as an external drive) while keeping their original location and context intact via `.ds` metadata files.

  It safely stashes your items elsewhere, leaving behind smart placeholders you can use to restore them at any time. Perfect for cleaning up your workspace without breaking your mental map of where everything lives.

  To install:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/trevortomesh/deep-stash.git
  cd deep-stash
  pip install .
  ```

  To use:

  1. Set the stash location:
     ```bash
     ds --init
     ```

  2. Stash an item:
     ```bash
     ds FinalPaper.pdf
     ```

  3. Restore an item:
     ```bash
     ds FinalPaper.pdf.ds
     ```

  4. View help and advanced options:
     ```bash
     ds --help
     ```

  DeepStash integrates beautifully with Stash to offload rarely used files after sorting â€” but it's equally effective on its own when you just need to move things without losing your structure.
